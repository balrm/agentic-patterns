## 🏦 **Banking Loan Eligibility Demo Results**

### **Chain-of-Thought Pattern Test**
**Prompt**: "I have 1million in my acount, will I get a bank loan of 500k"

**Actual Output (Google Gemini)**:
```
=== ACTUAL OUTPUT ===
Response: Whether you'll get a $500,000 loan with $1,000,000 in your account depends on several factors beyond just the account balance:

1. **Credit Score:** Your credit history is paramount. A high credit score (750 or above) significantly improves your chances. A low score, even with a million dollars in the bank, could result in denial or higher interest rates.

2. **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Lenders look at your existing debts (credit cards, mortgages, loans) relative to your income. Even with $1,000,000, high existing debt could negatively impact your application. They want to see you can comfortably handle the additional debt.

3. **Loan Purpose:** The reason for the loan matters. A loan for a well-established business with strong financials is much more likely to be approved than a loan for a high-risk venture or personal use with no clear repayment plan.

4. **Bank's Policies:** Different banks have different lending criteria. Some may be more conservative than others. Some may prioritize relationship banking – if you're a long-standing customer with a strong relationship, you might have better odds.

5. **Collateral:** While you have $1,000,000 in your account, the bank might still require additional collateral, especially for a loan this size. This could be your home, other assets, or even the business you're financing.

6. **Income Verification:** Even though you have a significant amount of money in your account, the bank will want to verify your income to ensure you have a stable source of funds to repay the loan.

**In short:** Having $1,000,000 in your account greatly increases your chances of getting a $500,000 loan, but it's not a guarantee. Your credit score, debt-to-income ratio, loan purpose, and the bank's lending policies all play a crucial role. It's best to contact several banks and discuss your situation directly with loan officers to determine your eligibility.
